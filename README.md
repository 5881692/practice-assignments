# Practice assignments - README

You're going to implement you're very own Matrix Method in Python. To get you started, I've provided you with a structure of classes and some startup code.

## Git repository instructions
This git repository contains your practice assignments for the workshops and some additional exercises. It also includes a predefined `.gitignore` and a `requirements.txt` for your convenience. Start this assignment by forking and cloning the repository so that you can work on it locally.

If you'd like to add the solutions to your local personal repository to compare the changes to your own code: add this repository as an additional remote to your local personal repository and fetch this remote:

```
git remote add upstream git@github.com:CIEM5000-2025/practice-assignments.git
git fetch upstream
```

Afterwards, you can compare the different branches locally and/or merge branches.

## Workshops
During the workshops you'll add some basic features to your code. Teachers are present during these sessions to help you! Start each workshop in `Workshop_*_Implement.ipynb` which guides you through the provided code and required additions. This includes changing code in `./matrixmethod/` and making sure you've implemented them correctly using the sanity checks provided. Afterwards, apply your code to a somewhat more difficult problem in `Workshop_**_Apply.ipynb`. These workshops are not graded. The full solutions are provided after the workshop session in the form of updated notebook files `Workshop_*_**.ipynb` and a correct implementation in `./matrixmethod/` on a separate branch `workshop_*`.

## Additional exercises
If you'd like to practise more or if you're looking for a more difficult challenge, have a look at the additional exercises in `Additional_**`.  The full solutions are provided after the second workshop session in the form of updated notebook files `Additional_**.ipynb` and a correct implementation in `./matrixmethod/`: solutions [Additional_exercises](https://github.com/CIEM5000-2025/practice-assignments/tree/solution_additional_exercises) with [changes](https://github.com/CIEM5000-2025/practice-assignments/compare/solution_workshop_1...solution_additional_exercises).

## Good luck!
